# ReactApp

## How does it work?
It gets a list of the first 300 Pokémons from PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) and displays their information.

## Instructions

On terminal, go to the project folder and use `npm start` to start the server. 

Then, open your browser and go to `localhost:3000` to use the app locally.

**The app needs internet connection to work properly.**
